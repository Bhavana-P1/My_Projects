## Research Projects
### Hubble Tension and Exotic Stellar Physics (ongoing)
The goal of this research project is analyzing cepheid variables and their period-luminosity relation as a means to study the distance ladder, and trying to explain the discrepency in Hubble's constant by incorporating new physics in late time measurements. 
### Entanglement in spin ensemble cavity systems (ongoing)
In this project, I will be investigating the entanglement between two level atoms and between the atoms and photons in a strongly interacting system consisting of an ensemble of atoms or spins inside a quantum cavity
